            <p>Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. Part of the Voyager program to study
                the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 42
                years, 3 months and 9 days as of December 14, 2019, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep
                Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. At a distance of 147.380 AU
                (22.0 billion km; 13.7 billion mi) from Earth as of November 4, 2019 it is the most distant man-made
                object from Earth.</p>
            <p>The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Although the
                spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby,
                exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. Voyager 1
                studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide
                detailed images of their moons.</p>
            <p>After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12, 1980, Voyager 1 became the
                third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity required to leave the Solar
                System. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the
                heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.</p>
